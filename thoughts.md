# What should you do?

This is the essential question. It's the one question you face every moment in your life, determining what next action you take. In one sense, this is a very easy question to answer: You should do what best achieves your goals. But in another sense it is a very hard question to answer, because it prompts some difficult follow-up questions: What are your goals? Which actions will best achieve them? How do you even tell when your goals are best achieved? These are very hard questions to answer, and attempting to answer them will generate further questions still. 

The first section of this website is dedicated to answering the question "What should you do?", along with its follow-ups.

## Law and ethics

Before we go much futher, let's clarify the difference between law and ethics. Law describes what you *can* do while ethics describes what you *should* do. In general, ethics is stricter than law. 

To help understand this distinction, consider a scenario with two characters: Nancy and Debbie. Imagine that Nancy says something mean and insulting to Debbie. There's no law against this, the world would be a better place if Nancy hadn't said it. In other words, it wasn't something that Nancy *should* have done. Nancy acted legally, but unethically.

As mentioned above, this document is concerned with the question: "What should you do?". It is concerned primarily with ethics, not with law.

## What are your goals?

You should do what best achieves your goals. But what are your goals?

There are two kinds of goals: those that are good in and of themselves, and those that are good because they help you achieve other goals. (In an ethics class I took, these were termed "inherent goals" and "instrumental goals", respectively.)

For example, consider the goal of becoming happy. There's no *reason* why you want to be happy -- you just do. It is an inherent goal. In contrast, consider the goal of eating cake. There *is* a reason you want to eat cake: because it makes you happy. Therefore it is not an inherent goal. It's important to distinguish between inherent and non-inherent goals, because once you know your inherent goals you can derive your non-inherent goals. 

## Inherent goals

Therefore, it is useful for us to define our inherent goals. We are answering the question:  What is good *in and of itself*, not just because it is in the service of another goal?

I propose the following are everyone's inherent goals:

* To achieve happiness for yourself. This entails surviving comfortably.
* To achieve happiness for other people.
* To connect with other people. This means hearing and understanding their life stories, and having them understand your life story.
* To know truth and knowledge. To understand what's going on in the world and how the universe works.

Most anyone should agree that these are good things. In order to show they are *inherent* goals, though, we must show that each one is not good only because it is used to obtain another. But this also means there is no way to explain *why* it is good. It will seem good *just because*. 

This is a hard section to write because it's impossible to justify the claims I'm making. Because of that, I understand if you don't fully believe everything I'm saying here. However, I hope that you can at least humor me and agree to roll with these for the remainder of this document.

That said, I will still attempt to justify these inherent goals as well as I can. To do that, I will imagine four worlds: in each one, three of the goals are satisfied and one is missing. For each, I will propose that it seems like a *bad* world: It will seem like a world that you wouldn't choose to create if you had a choice. That will show that all four of the goals are necessary for making a good world.

### A world where you are not happy

Imagine a world where the people around you are happy, and you've talked with each of them and come to understand their stories. Furthermore, scientific knowledge flourishes, and everyone has a solid and truthful understand of what's going on in the world and universe. But nevertheless you are miserable. Maybe there's some aching, physical pain in your body. You are starving, for example. This is not a world you would choose to create.

### A world where others are not happy

Imagine a similar world, except in this one everyone else is suffering but you. Note that you *are* happy in this world even though everyone else isn't (I guess this means you have no empathy). Even though you are happy, is the a world you would choose to create? For me, it isn't. If you could choose to make other people happy too, you might as well, right? Therefore, the happiness of other people is inherently good, and is not good only because it makes you happy.

### A world where people aren't connected

Now imagine a world where everyone is happy even though people never talk to each other or communicate in anyway (I guess the people in this world don't get lonely for whatever reason). But, even though everyone is happy, is this a world you would choose to create? For me, it isn't. It just seems like missing the point of life (though again, I admit, I cannot explain why I feel this way).

### A world without truth and knowledge

Would you choose a world where everyone lives happy lives but is completely ignorant of how the universe works? Or a world where everyone lives happy lives but consistently believes false rumors about what their other people are doing? Even though believing these falsehoods has no impact on their happiness, this is still not a world I would choose to create.

Talking to people, I've found that this is the inherent goal people have the hardest time accepting. So I will add a few more exacmples.

First, I'll reiterate a thought experiment that was told to me in an ethics class I took. It goes like this: Imagine a world where everyone lives in virtual reality game all the time. And in this virtual reality everyone is made happy all the time. And it's a multiplayer game, so everyone can communicate with each other. Still, I argue this is not a world I want to live in. Even though I would happy in this game, I would still want to know what's happening in the *real world*. Why? Just because. The virtual reality world would feel *fake* and *shallow*, for some reason. We crave authenticity. Reality matters.

Here's another thought experiment: Imagine that your signficant other has cheated on you (also imagine that cheating is something that would upset you). Imagine that this cheating only happens once and carries no health risks. If you didn't know, you could go on living blissfully unaware. Would you want to know? I would argue that you would want to know *even if that's guaranteed to make your life less happy*.

## Weighing conflicting goals

As stated eariler, there are multiple goals which are inherently good. Each of these goals does not exist merely to help achieve the other goals. This entails it is possible for these goals to conflict.

Happiness conflicting with truth is a simple and common case. In the cheating example from earlier, I said you would probably want to know if your significant other cheated on you. But maybe you, reader, don't personally feel that way. Maybe you would prefer to remain blissfully unaware.

It's not an easy choice. In one case you lose out on happiness, and in the other case you lose out on truth. Because attaining happiness and truth are both goals, it's not obvious what the better case is.

Therfore, the only way to make this choice is to *weigh* the goals for this specific case. We can apply this principle: If the loss of happiness is small and the gain to truth is big, we should choose truth. But if the loss of happiness is big and the gain of truth is small, we should choose happiness. Most choices in life are like this, requring us to weigh conflicting goals.

But now we have a new problem: How do we quantify whether a loss of happiness or truth is "big" or "small"? I can't answer that question here. For one, this very much depends on personal values. And two, this very much depends on the specific details of the situation. It cannot be determined in a general, abstract, philosophical sense.

## Incremental effects

I've talked about weighing the effects of choices, and it's important to understand that effects are usually not binary. Usually a result of a choice is not simply "good" or "bad". It is good or bad with a certain amount. And there are often many choices that get in-between results.

Consider an example case of deciding whether or not to eat in a vegetarian way. One positive effect of making this choice is that it will reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere, slowing global warming, and making everyone in the world happier. One negative effect of making this choice is that you will eat less tasty food, making you less happy.

I've often seen people talk about this like it's a binary choice. The claim is that people usually "become vegetarian" and then never eat a piece of meat ever again. That's a good choice for the world, and we should applaud those people.

However, we must acknowledge that 99% vegetarianism is *almost* as good, and those people should be applauded *almost* as much. If your goal is to reduce carbon emissions, then someone who eats vegetarian 99% of the time is having 99% of the impact. (Actually, it may not be exactly 99% impact, but let's not sweat the details. My point is that it has most of the impact.)

The same can be said for any percentage of vegetarianism. 75% vegetarianism is less good than 99% but better than 0%. Similarly 50% vegetarianism is less good than 75% but better than 0%. And so on.

Therefore, when weighing the effects on your goals from making choice, you must consider these incremental effects. The effects won't simply be "good" or "bad", but will be somewhere in between.

## Expected goodness

Suppose that you know your personal values very well. Does this mean it's easy to weigh conflicting goals in order to make decisions? No, because at the time you're making the decision, you're not exactly sure how things are going to turn out. 

Consider an example scenario where Nancy is a legislator deciding whether to impose a tariff on shoes. Nancy listens to arguments from both sides: If the tariff is imposed, it will hurt consumers by raising prices, but it will help the country's shoe industry. If the tariff is not imposed, the country's shoe industry will suffer, but consumers will have cheaper prices. Nancy weighs the situation and personal values and is prepared to make a decision.

But wait! How certain are we that imposing the tariff will have the stated effects? The world is a very complicated place -- there may be lots of hidden effects, and economics 101 arguments are not always going to be accurate. Imagine that Nancy decides not to impose the tariff, but the effects on the country's shoe industry are far worse than predicted. Then it might turn out that Nancy made the wrong decision. Or the vice versa could happen.

Having more data and experience will help you reduce uncertainty and make decisions more confidently. But there will always be some uncertainty. It's important to be cognizant of how much uncertainty there is. Decisions need to be made taking into account how certain you are of the potential outcomes. 

Or, said another way: Would you make a choice that has a small chance of great success, or one that has a large chance of small success? This is yet another tradeoff that needs to be weighed when making decisions.

## Anomalies and patterns

Imagine a scenario where Nancy's roommate Debbie is playing loud music, and this prevents Nancy from sleeping well. Should Nancy confront Debbie? One positive impact of this choice could be that Debbie turns the music down and Nancy is happier. This is a small effect that is certain to occur. One negative impact of this choice could be that the confrontation goes badly and it ruins their friendship, and both are less happy. This is a big effect, but it's less likely to occur.

Presented like this, it's not obvious what Nancy should do.

Next, supposed that Debbie plays loud music *every single day* for weeks and weeks. Now, it's obvious that Nancy should confront Debbie. Why? Because the incremental negative effects have added up. It's important to understand that positive and negative effects accumulate.

This leads us to the following general principle: Often, anomalous negative effects can be tolerated (unless they're *really* bad). However, patterns of negative effects must be dealt with. Otherwise, they will keep adding up and end up really bad.

## Sum up

When making choices, consider what the effects are on competing life goals (truth, happiness, etc.). Understand that effects are often incremental and consider the in-between choices. Be sure to weigh probabilties of actually obtaining the expected effects. Understand that isolated incidents of badness may be tolerated, but patterns of badness must be addressed.

# A wider view of morality

I have presented a framework with which you can evaluate choices and make decisions. In theory, that should be all you need for a complete system of morality. However, that section only presents a microscopic view of decision making, and a complete system of morality also needs a macroscopic view. I will fill that in here, and examine some of the inherent goals in a wider context.

## Utilitarianism and justice

In the section on decision making, I explained that you should make decisions that optimize your goals. Following this principle leads one to a system of morality called *utilitarianism*: you should do what creates the most goodness (or "utility") for the world.

But actually, I don't think utilitarianism is a complete system of morality, because it ignores the concept of *justice*. Justice says you cannot do bad things to people if they do not "deserve" it, even if it is for the greater good. It is not acceptable to arbitrarily rearrange the world to optimize goals, because the independence of other people must be respected.

To understand this, consider the following thought experiment I heard in my ethics class:

Nancy is a surgeon at a hospital. Nancy's hospital is currently taking care of some very important people, such as a world-class scientist on the cusp of formualating a theory of everything, a world-class artist who has entertained and inspired people around the world, and a world-class diplomat who has ended a great war and is needed to keep the world from falling into war yet again. But these people are dying. The scientist needs a liver transplant, the artist needs a lung transplant, and the diplomat needs a heart transplant. Unfortunately, the hospital lacks the resources.

But life at the hospital continues. One day, a youth named Debbie shows up at the hospital. Debbie is just passing through a needs a place to stay for the night. Nancy allows Debbie to stay, and they get to talking. In their conversation, Nancy learns that Debbie is an orphan with no home, family, or friends. Debbie is uneducated and has no interest in learning. From their conversation, it becomes clear to Nancy that Debbie has no future and will likely fall to crime and drugs. It becomes clear that Debbie will never do any good for the world.

Should Nancy kill Debbie and redistribute Debbie's organs to save the world-class scientist, artist, and diplomat? No, of course not. Even though this would certainly increase the amount of goodness in the world, it is not *just*. In fact, this tenet of morality is so deeply ingrained in us that the idea of killing Debbie has probably not even crossed Nancy's mind.

### The specialness of people

The concept of justice points out a distinct aspect of morality: the inherent "specialness" or sacredness of people. There is an idea that each and every person is important and must be respected. That they must be treated with justice. 

Furthemore, I argue this specialness is exactly what it means to be a person. Morality says you can destory a robot and use its parts to create other better things. But you cannot do that with a person. People are a special case in morality. One day in the future, people may feel the same way about robots. Then we will know robots have attained personhood.

I will attempt to formalize this "specialness". How does it fit into the inherent goals I talked about earlier? The goals of making yourself and other people happy.

It doesn't. Up until this point I have pretened that the happiness of yourself and others is quantifiable. But unfortunately, this isn't the case.

Formally, the "specialness" of people is the statement that people cannot be ascribed a value. They do not have a set value, and they do not have zero value either. The concept of value actually does not even apply. This is what distinguishes people from objects. Objects are only worth as much as their value, so if an object can be destroyed to create another object of higher value, it should be.

I will now show that the concept of value does not apply to people.

#### People do not have zero value

If a person dies, it is bad. Therefore, a person cannot have zero value.

#### People do not have a finite value

If two people die, it is worse than if one person dies. But how much worse? Is it twice as worse? No, I don't think you could say that. Maybe it's something like 1.9x worse, or 2.1x worse? No, I don't think you could ever come to a conclusion like that, either. In fact, I don't think we have any way to quanify how much worse it is. It's worse, but not worse by a specific amount. Therefore, people must not have a set value.

### The irrationality of ethics

How can we hope to make decisions rationally if the value of people and their happiness cannot be weighed precisely?

We can't. Believing in the "specialness" of people entails that ethics must be irrational. Ethics is fuzzy. We can say things like "two people being unhappy is worse than one person being unhappy", but we cannot say how much worse. And therefore it is possible to construct situations that are undecideable.

Would you go out of your way to make one person unhappy in order to make two other people happy? Maybe not, because it is unjust. Would you make one person unhappy to make everyone else on Earth happy? Maybe. Maybe justice is outweighed at that point. What about if it would make 50% of people on Earth happy? Is it worth it then? What about 25%? 75%? I argue that there is a whole, huge grey area where you simply will not know what to do. You cannot weigh precisely. There is not an obvious choice.

### The ethics of "I don't know"

We can construct any number of thought experiments the ethics are fuzzy enough that we simply cannot tell what to do.

Here's one: You're on a boat with your two children. Suddenly you hit a wave, and one of your children falls off the right side of the boat, and your other child falls off the left side of the boat. You only have time to save one of the children from drowning. What do you do? (Or more importantly, what is your thought process?)

I propose that you simply would not know what to do. You wouldn't start reasoning in your head about which one has the most potential to do good for the world, and save that one. They are both special to you, and you're not going to reason out why one is better than the other.

In the end, you would act and save one of them. Because saving one is better than standing there and doing nothing. But you would have no justification for *why* you saved a particular one. You might even be able to say some reasons if asked, but you would know in your heart that nothing can truly justify not saving the other.

Ultimately, we must accept that there are certain decisions where the only response is "I don't know.", and yet we must choose to act anyway.

## On facts and lies

Let us now examine the inherent goal of truth and knowledge more closely.

If truth is good, then ethics dictates we should tell the truth. However, this principle is not always so simple, so I will expand upon it.

*It's possible to be misleading by stating true facts, and this is as bad as lying*. Also, telling certain lies is sometimes justifiable, if it leads people to better understanding. I will illustrate these two points.

### Misleading with facts is as bad as lying

To justify this, I will use a thought experiment I heard in a linguistics class. 

Consider a scenario where Nancy asks Debbie: "Do you have four children?". Debbie does in fact have five children, but Debbie responds "I have a child."

In this situation, Debbie has said a true fact: Debbie does in fact have a child. However, Nancy is likely to interpret this response as meaning "I have exactly one child but not four." Debbie has not lied, but Debbie has been misleading by ommitting information. Debbie has led Nancy to the same incorrect conclusion that would have happened if Debbie had simply lied and said "No, I only have one." In other words, this is a case where being misleading with true facts is equivalent to lying.

Politicians do this all the time: say a thing which is technically true but likely to mislead people who don't think carefully. This is just as unethical as lying.

Before I go on, you might object by asking me: "Isn't Nancy at fault for not thinking carefully about what Debbie said?"

It is true that when faced with a potentially malicious person, it is in Nancy's best interest to act with prudence. However, it would be a better world if that was unnecessary and Debbie had not been misleading in the first place. Debbie did something Debbie *should* not have done -- therefore, Debbie acted unethically, which is what this document is concerned with.

# Identity and culture

Up until this point, I have been writing about decision making (ethics). I am now going to write about an entirely different topic that I care about: the concept of identity.

## All that matters is what you do, not who you are

What matters is satisfying the inherent goals while obeying principles of justice. The inherent goals are only affected by concrete actions taken in the world, not by thoughts.

Therefore, I will not comment on the goodness or badness of ideologies and groups of people. I will only comment on the goodness and badness of actions.

## Who am I?

Do not ask me if I am a liberal or a conservative. I don't think that's a very useful question to ask. Instead, ask me what actions I think the country should take on a particular issue. That's what really matters.

Do not ask me if I am a man or a woman. Would that tell you what kind of job I should have? Would that tell you what kind of clothes I should wear? Would it tell you which other people I am friends with? What kind of books I read or shows I watch? No, it would not. Anyone could have any kind of job, anyone could wear any clothes. Anyone could be friends with anyone. Anyone could read any books or watch any shows. Therefore, it is not a useful question to ask.

Do not ask me if I am straight or gay or something else. Instead ask me if I want to have sex with a particular person -- that's what you really wanted to know, right?

Do not ask me if I am a vegetarian. Instead, ask if I would choose to eat a given food.

I don't identify as a liberal, or a conservative, or a moderate. I don't identify as a man or a woman, as straight or gay, or vegetarian. I'm just myself and I have opinions on which actions should be taken in given scenarios. I don't think the action of identifying as anything is helpful. All that matters is what you do, not who you are.

Identifying as something means applying that label to yourself. I apply no labels to myself or to other people.

## Identity can be helpful

I know reasons why other people identify as things.

Labels can be helpful: they are shorthands for describing what actions you think should be taken in given scenarios. For example, if someone identifies as a liberal, you can make reasonable guesses about what actions they think the country should take in response to certain issues. That kind of shorthand can be helpful, since it is convenient. 

Labels have other benefits, too. They can provide rallying cries, or banners to march behind. They can provide support groups. If you find other people with your same label, it comforts you.

## Identity can be harmful

But even though labels have these sorts of benefits, I think their cons are far stronger, and it is for that reason I refuse to apply labels to myself or others.

Labels limit you. If you consider yourself as being a certain label, you will be less open minded about what you can and cannot do. The label is your preconceived notion about what you do.

When you think to yourself: "I'm the kind of person who's not good at math.", you become not good at math. That kind of label is just an excuse to not try. It is a self-fulfilling prophesy. Anyone could become good at math if they put in the effort.

Labels encourage "us vs. them" mentalities. They make people divide the world into those who have the label, and those who don't. This encourages ad hominem attacks, where arguments are discounted on the basis of who they come from, rather than for their own merits.

Labels encourage echo chambers. People congregate with other that have the same label because it makes them feel more comfortable. Then they say only what the others in the group want to hear, so they are more accepted. This encourages lazy argumentation, just repeating talking points without delving into the possibly uncomfortable subtleties.

When you label yourself, you will interpet arguments against your label's position as a personal attacks. And once your own self is called into question, your insecurities will trigger and you will no longer hear logic.

In short, identifying erodes intelligent conversation.

## Asking questions is almost always okay

Identifying as a label encourages you to treat certain topics as sacred and unquestionable. Questions are to be scoffed at: "How dare someone question this, any good person should agree!" But this is bad, because it erodes intelligent conversation. Asking questions is almost always okay.

Why wouldn't it be? You might propose that asking certain question is bad because the answer is really obvious, and it's a waste of time to answer it. But, if the answer is really so obvious, it should be a quick answer, right? Therefore, it wouldn't be too much of a waste of time.

That's the cool thing about questions. Obvious questions have quick and easy answers, so there's no harm in asking them. Whereas non-obvious questions have difficult and nuanced answers, but since it's a non-obvious question, it deserves to be asked. Therefore, it's okay to ask almost all questions.

## On culture

Culture is a group of people with shared identity. All the problems that I said identity has, culture also has. Therefore I recommend culture being avoided in excess.

## The only label that matters is "person"

The only thing I label myself and others as is a person. Thinking of yourself and others as a person is necessary for upholding principles of justice. There may be some cons for using this label: perhaps it encourages "us vs. them" mentalities with respects to animals, machines, and the natural world. But I think this label is worth it most the time.
