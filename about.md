# About and disclaimers

Hello. I am the person who wrote this website. This website is a repository of my personal thoughts to be shared with anyone who is interested.

I expect that you, reader, will disagree with some of the ideas I've presented. That's okay. Actually, the reason I'm writing this website is that I haven't seen these ideas commonly represented. If everyone already agreed with these ideas, then I wouldn't need to argue in favor of them, right? 

Even if these ideas seem strange, I hope that you will keep an open mind and at least consider them.

## On mutability

This website and its ideas are mutable. They are open to being questioned and changed. A lot of these ideas may be no good, and I am willing to give up on them or replace them. 

Please keep in mind that just because I had these ideas at the time I was writing this website, it doesn't necessarily mean that I still have them today. This website may be outdated. I want to keep this website updated with my current thoughts, but no promises. Maybe one day I will forget about it.

## Who am I?

I don't think it matters. Please judge my words for what they are, not on the basis of who said them.
