A Statement of Personal Philosophy

# On mutability

This document and my ideas are mutable. They are open to being questioned and changed. Just because I had these ideas once doesn't mean that I still have them today. I would like to try to keep this document updated, but no promises. Maybe one day I will forget about it and it will languish on the internet.

# The difference between law and ethics

The difference between law and ethics is that law describes what you *can* do while ethics describes what you *should* do. To understand the distinction, consider the action of saying a mean thing to someone. There's no law against this, but it's still not something you should do. It is legal but unethical. In general, ethics are stricter than law.

This document is primarily concerned with ethics.

# What should you do?

This is the essential question. It's the one question you face every moment in your life, determining what next action you take. In one sense, this is a very easy question to answer: You should do that which best achieves your goals. But in another sense it is a very hard question to answer, because it prompts some difficult follow-up questions: What are your goals? Which actions will best achieve them? How do you even tell when your goals are best achieved? These are very hard questions to answer, and attempting to answer them will generate further questions still. Nevertheless, will try to answer those questions here.

# What are your goals?

There are two kinds of goals: those that are good in and of themselves ("inherent goals"), and those that are good because they help you achieve other goals.

For example, you might argue that becoming happy is an inherent goal. There's no *reason* why you want to be happy -- you just do. In contrast, something like eating lots of cake is a goal but not an inherent goal: the reason you want to eat cake is because it makes you happy, not simply for the sake of eating cake. It's important to distinguish between inherent and non-inherent goals, because once you know your inherent goals you can derive your non-inherent goals. Therefore, in order to know what do do, you must first answer the following question: What are your inherent goals? What is good *in and of itself*, not just because it is in the service of another goal?

I propose that the following are the inherent goals of each person:
* To achieve happiness for yourself. This entails surviving comfortably.
* To achieve happiness for other people.
* To connect with other people. This means hearing and understanding their life stories, and having them understand your life story.
* To know truth and knowledge. To understand what's going on in the world and how the universe works.

Most anyone should agree that these are good things. In order to show they are *inherent* goals, though, we must show that each one is not good only because it is used to obtain another. In other words, there will be no way to explain *why* it is good. It will seem good *just because*. This is a hard section to write because it's impossible to justify the claims I'm making. Because of that, I totally understand if you don't fully believe everything I'm saying here. However, I hope that you can at least humor me and agree to roll with these for the remainder of this document.

That said, I will attempt to justify these inherent goals as well as I can. To do that, I will imagine four worlds: each one one, three of the goals are satisfied and one is missing. Then I will propose that this is a bad world. That will show that all four of the goals are necessary, and one is not merely in service of another.

## A world where you are not happy

Imagine a world where the people around you are happy, and you've talked with each of them and come to understand their stories. Furthermore, scientific knowledge flourishes, and everyone has a solid and truthful understand of what's going on in the world and universe. But nevertheless you are miserable. Perhaps there is some aching, physical pain in your body. You are starving, for example. This is not a world you want to live in.

## A world where others are not happy

Imagine a similar world except in this one everyone else is suffering but you. Note that you *are* happy in this world even though everyone else isn't (I guess this means you have no empathy). Even though you are happy, is the a world you would work to create? For me, it isn't. Therefore, the happiness of other people is inherently good, and is not only good because it makes you happy.

## A world where people aren't connected

Now imagine a world where everyone is happy even though people never talk to each other or communicate in anyway. I guess the people in this world don't get lonely for whatever reason. But, even everyone is happy, is this a world you would work to create? For me, it isn't. It just seems like missing the point of life (though again, I admit, I cannot explain why I feel this way).

## A world without truth and knowledge

To justify this one, I'll reiterate a thought experiment that was told to me in an ethics class I took. It goes like this: Imagine a world where everyone lives in virtual reality game all the time. And in this virtual reality everyone is made happy all the time. And it's a multiplayer game, so everyone can communicate with each other. Still, I argue this is not a world I want to live in. Even though I would happy in this game, I would still want to know what's happening in the *real world*. That's important. The virtual reality world would feel fake and shallow. Thus, knowing the truth about the world is important.

Here's another thought experiment: Imagine that your signficant other has cheated on you (and cheating is something that would upset you). Imagine that this cheating only happened once and carried no health risks. If you didn't know, you could go on living blissfully unaware. Would you want to know? I would argue that you would want to know *even if that's guaranteed to make your life less happy*.

# Goals sometimes conflict

# On identity

All that matters is what you do, not who you are.

Do not ask me if I am a liberal or a conservative. I don't think that's a very useful question to ask. Instead, ask me what actions I think the country should take on a particular issue. That's what really matters.

I don't identify as a liberal, or a conservative, or a moderate, or anything. I'm just myself and I have opinions on which actions should be taken in given scenarios. You can agree or disagree with those actions. You can provide evidence and arguments in support or criticism of those actions. That's much more focused than attempting to argue against the entire concept of liberalism or the entire concept of conservativism, and therefore more likely to produce useful ideas.

Do not ask me if I am straight or gay or something else. Instead ask me if I want to have sex with a particular person.

Do not ask me if I am a man or a woman. Would that tell you what kind of job I should have? Would that tell you what kind of clothes I should wear? Would it tell you which other people I am friends with? What kind of books I read or shows I watch? No, it would not. Anyone could have any kind of job, anyone could wear any clothes. Anyone could be friends with anyone. Anyone could read any books or watch any shows. When people apply the label of "man" or "woman" to themselves, it means they want to associate with a given set of steretypes and social roles. Well, I associate with no stereotypes or social roles. I will do whatever I want, regardless if it's a thing that only men are supposed to do or only women are supposed to do.

Identifying as something means applying that label to yourself. Labels can be helpful: they are shorthands for describing what actions you think should be taken in given scenarios. For example, if someone identifies as a liberal, you can make reasonable guesses about what actions they think the country should take in response to certain issues. That kind of shorthand can be helpful, since it is convenient. Labels have other benefits, too. For example, they can provide rallying cries, or banners to march behind.

But even though labels have these sorts of benefits, I think their cons are far stronger, and it is for that reason I refuse to apply labels to myself or others.

Labels encourage echo chambers. Just repeating talking points without thinking through subtleties. Us vs. them mentalities, where other human beings are labeled as demons, as enemies, to be ignored and shunned. They encourage ad hominem attacks, where arguments are ignored on the basis of who they come from rather than for their own benefits. In short, labels erode reasonable argument and conversation.

When you think to yourself: "I'm the kind of person who's not good at math." you become not good at math. It is a self-fulfilling prophesy. I fully believe that most people are able to become good at any one given thing if only they put in the effort. But people labeling themselves limits themselves.

When you label yourself, hearing any argument against your label's position you interpret as a personal attack on your own identity. And once the goodness of your person is brough into question, you will no longer hear logic.

# On facts and lies

I hope I've made the case that truth is good. But what is true and what is false is not always so simple.

It's possible to be misleading by stating true facts, and this is as bad as lying. Also, telling certain lies is sometimes justifiable, if it leads people to better understands. I will illustrate these two points.

Consider a scenario with two characters: Nancy and Debbie. Nancy asks Debbie: "Do you have five children?". Debbie does in fact have five children, but Debbie responds "I have a child."

In this situation, Debbie has said a true fact: Debbie does in fact have a child. However, Nancy is likely to interpret this response as meaning "I have exactly one child but not five." Debbie has not lied, but Debbie has been misleading by ommitting information. Debbie has led Nancy to the same incorrect conclusion that would have happened if Debbie had simply lied and said "No, I only have one." In other words, being misleading with truth facts in this case is equivalent to lying.

Politicians do this all the time: say a thing which is technically true but likely to mislead people who don't think carefully. This is just as unethical as lying.

Before I go on, you might object by asking me: "Isn't Nancy at fault for not thinking carefully about what Debbie said?"

It is true that when faced with a potentially malicious person, it is in Nancy's best interest to act with prudence. However, it would be a better world if that was unnecessary and Debbie had not been misleading in the first place. Debbie did something Debbie *should* not have done -- therefore, Debbie acted unethically, which is what this document is concerned with.
