# About and disclaimers

Hello. I am the person who wrote this website. This website is a repository of my personal thoughts to be shared with anyone who is interested.

I expect that you, reader, will disagree with some of the ideas I've presented. That's okay. Actually, the main reason I'm writing this website is because I haven't seen these ideas commonly represented. If everyone already agreed with these ideas, then I wouldn't need to argue in favor of them, right? However, I hope that you will keep an open mind and at least consider my ideas. If you want to submit arguments against them, feel free to send them to me at my contact email address: negative.nancy.ng {at} gmail.com. Don't expect a response, but I may consider your idea and update this website.

## On mutability

This document and my ideas are mutable. They are open to being questioned and changed. A lot of my ideas may be wrong, and I am willing to give up on them, or replace them. 

Please keep in mind that just because I had these ideas at the time I was writing this website, it doesn't mean that I still have them today. I want to keep this website updated with my current thoughts, but no promises. Maybe one day I will forget about it, and it will languish on the internet.

## On misinterpretation

Many readers will misinterpret what I've written. I recognize this is inevitable. Please, before you angrily jump to argue against my ideas, carefully consider if you are understanding the intent behind the words. I mean no ill will towards anyone. My true wish is happiness for each and every person in the world. As you read through this website, please don't forget that.

In order to help prevent misinterpretation, I have used no sarcasm in this website.

# What should you do?

This is the essential question. It's the one question you face every moment in your life, determining what next action you take. In one sense, this is a very easy question to answer: You should do what best achieves your goals. But in another sense it is a very hard question to answer, because it prompts some difficult follow-up questions: What are your goals? Which actions will best achieve them? How do you even tell when your goals are best achieved? These are very hard questions to answer, and attempting to answer them will generate further questions still. 

The first section of this website is dedicated to answering the question "What should you do?", along with its follow-ups.

## Law and ethics

Before we go much futher, let's clarify the difference between law and ethics. Law describes what you *can* do while ethics describes what you *should* do. In general, ethics is stricter than law. 

To help understand this distinction, consider a scenario with two characters: Nancy and Debbie. Imagine that Nancy says something mean and insulting to Debbie. There's no law against this, but we must acknowledge that the world would be a better place if Nancy hadn't said it. In other words, it wasn't something that Nancy *should* have done. Nancy acted legally, but unethically.

As mentioned above, this document is concerned with the question: "What should you do?". It is concerned primarily with ethics, not with law.

## What are your goals?

You should do what best achieves your goals. But what are your goals?

There are two kinds of goals: those that are good in and of themselves ("inherent goals"), and those that are good because they help you achieve other goals.

For example, consider the goal of becoming happy. There's no *reason* why you want to be happy -- you just do. It is an inherent goal. In contrast consider the goal of eating cake. There is a reason you want to eat cake: because it makes you happy. Therefore it is not an inherent goal. It's important to distinguish between inherent and non-inherent goals, because once you know your inherent goals you can derive your non-inherent goals. 

Therefore, in order to answer the question "What should you do?" we must first answer the question: "What are you inherent goals?". What is good *in and of itself*, not just because it is in the service of another goal?

## Inherent goals

I propose that the following are the inherent goals of each person:
* To achieve happiness for yourself. This entails surviving comfortably.
* To achieve happiness for other people.
* To connect with other people. This means hearing and understanding their life stories, and having them understand your life story.
* To know truth and knowledge. To understand what's going on in the world and how the universe works.

Most anyone should agree that these are good things. In order to show they are *inherent* goals, though, we must show that each one is not good only because it is used to obtain another. But this also means there will be no way to explain *why* it is good. It will seem good *just because*. 

This is a hard section to write because it's impossible to justify the claims I'm making. Because of that, I understand if you don't fully believe everything I'm saying here. However, I hope that you can at least humor me and agree to roll with these for the remainder of this document.

That said, I will attempt to justify these inherent goals as well as I can. To do that, I will imagine four worlds: in each one, three of the goals are satisfied and one is missing. For each, I will propose that it seems like a bad world -- seems like a world you wouldn't work to create. There will be no justification, it will just seem bad. That will show that all four of the goals are necessary for making a good world.

### A world where you are not happy

Imagine a world where the people around you are happy, and you've talked with each of them and come to understand their stories. Furthermore, scientific knowledge flourishes, and everyone has a solid and truthful understand of what's going on in the world and universe. But nevertheless you are miserable. Maybe there's some aching, physical pain in your body. You are starving, for example. This is not a world you want to live in.

### A world where others are not happy

Imagine a similar world except in this one everyone else is suffering but you. Note that you *are* happy in this world even though everyone else isn't (I guess this means you have no empathy). Even though you are happy, is the a world you would work to create? For me, it isn't. Therefore, the happiness of other people is inherently good, and is not only good because it makes you happy.

### A world where people aren't connected

Now imagine a world where everyone is happy even though people never talk to each other or communicate in anyway (I guess the people in this world don't get lonely for whatever reason). But, even though everyone is happy, is this a world you would work to create? For me, it isn't. It just seems like missing the point of life (though again, I admit, I cannot explain why I feel this way).

### A world without truth and knowledge

To justify this one, I'll reiterate a thought experiment that was told to me in an ethics class I took. It goes like this: Imagine a world where everyone lives in virtual reality game all the time. And in this virtual reality everyone is made happy all the time. And it's a multiplayer game, so everyone can communicate with each other. Still, I argue this is not a world I want to live in. Even though I would happy in this game, I would still want to know what's happening in the *real world*. Why? Just because. The virtual reality world would feel fake and shallow, for some reason. Reality (and therefore, truth) matters.

Here's another thought experiment: Imagine that your signficant other has cheated on you (and cheating is something that would upset you). Imagine that this cheating only happened once and carried no health risks. If you didn't know, you could go on living blissfully unaware. Would you want to know? I would argue that you would want to know *even if that's guaranteed to make your life less happy*.

## Weighing conflicting goals

As stated eariler, there are multiple goals which are inherently good. Each of these goals does not exist merely to help achieve the other goals. This entails it is possible for these goals to conflict.

Truth conflicting with happiness is a simple case. In the cheating example from earlier, I said you would probably want to know if your significant other cheated on you. But maybe you, reader, don't personally feel that way. Maybe you would prefer to remain blissfully unaware.

It's not an easy choice. In one case you lose out on happiness, and in the other case you lose out on truth. Because attaining happiness and truth are both goals, it's not obvious what the better case is.

Therfore, the only way to make this choice is to *weigh* the goals for this specific case. We can apply this principle: If the loss of happiness is small and the gain to truth is big, we should choose truth. But if the loss of happiness is big and the gain of truth is small, we should choose happiness. Most choices in life are like this. We must weigh conflicting goals.

Now we have a new problem: How do we quantify whether a loss of happiness or truth is "big" or "small"? I can't answer that question in this document. For one, this very much depends on personal values. And two, this very much depends on the specific details of the situation. It cannot be determined in a general, abstract, philosophical sense.

## Incremental effects

I've talked about weighing the effects of choices, and it's important to understand that effects are usually not binary. Usually, a result of a choice is not simply "good" or "bad". It is good or bad with a certain amount. And there are often many ways to attain in-between results.

Consider an example case of deciding whether or not to eat in a vegetarian way. One positive effect of making this choice is that it will reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere, slowing global warming, and making everyone in the world happier. One negative effect of making this choice is that you will eat less tasty food, making you less happy.

I've often seen this presented as a binary choice. The claim is that people usually "become vegetarian" and then never eat a piece of meat ever again. That's a good choice for the world, and we should applaud those people.

*However*, we must be careful to mind that 99% vegetarianism is almost as good, and those people should be applauded almost as much. If your goal is to reduce carbon emissions, then someone who eats vegetarian 99% of the time is having 99% of the impact. (Actually, it may not be *exactly* 99% impact, but let's not sweat the details. My point is that it has most of the impact.)

The same can be said for any percentage of vegetarianism. 75% vegetarianism is less good than 99% but better than 0%. Similarly 50% vegetarianism is less good than 75% but better than 0%. And so on.

Therefore, when weighing the effects on your goals from making choice, you must consider these incremental effects. The effects won't simply be "good" or "bad", but will be somewhere in between.

## Exepcted goodness

Suppose that you know your personal values very well. Does this mean it's easy to weigh conflicting goals in order to make decisions? No, because at the time you're making the decision, you're not exactly sure how things are going to turn out. 

Consider an example scenario where Nancy is the ruler of the world, deciding whether to ban genetically modifying food.

Consider an example scenario where Nancy is deciding whether to ask out Debbie. 

Consider an example scenario where Nancy is a member of a city council, deciding whether to add parking meters downtown. Nancy reasons that the positive effect from this action is that the city will earn money. Nancy reasons that the negative effect from this action is that it will hurt downtown businesses, because shoppers are less likely to visit downtown because they don't want to pay for parking. Nancy weighs the benefits and personal values and is prepared to make a decision.

But wait -- how certain is it that adding parking meters will hurt local business? It might be the case that adding parking meters makes parking easier downtown, which increases throughput of shoppers, which actually ends up raising downtown business. It's hard to tell what will actually happen.

Therefore, decisions need to be made taking into account how certain you are of the potential outcomes. Would you make a choice that has a small chance of great success, or one that has a large chance of small success? This is yet another tradeoff that needs to be weighed according to your personal values and the situation.

## Anomalies and patterns

Imagine a scenario where Nancy's roommate Debbie is playing loud music, and this prevents Nancy from sleeping well. Should Nancy confront Debbie? One positive impact of this choice could be that Debbie turns the music down and Nancy is happier. This is a small effect that is certain to occur. One negative impact of this choice could be that the confrontation goes badly and it ruins their friendship, and both are less happy. This is a big effect, but it's less likely to occur.

Presented like this, it's not obvious what Nancy should do.

Next, supposed that Debbie plays loud music *every single day* for weeks and weeks. Now, it's obvious that Nancy should confront Debbie. Why? Because the incremental negative effects have added up. It's important to understand that positive and negative effects accumulate.

This leads us to the following general principle: Often, anomalous negative effects can be tolerated (unless they're *really* bad). However, once you have a pattern of negative effects, something must be done. Otherwise, they will keep adding up and end up really bad.

## Sum up

When making choices, consider what the effects are on competing life goals (truth, happiness, etc.). Understand that effects are often incremental, not black and white, and consider the in-between choices. Be sure to weigh probabilties of actually obtaining the expected effects. Understand that isolated incidents of badness may be tolerated, but patterns of badness must be addressed.

# A wider view of morality

I have presented a framework with which you can evaluate choices and make decisions. In theory, that should be all you need for a complete system of morality. However, that section only presents a microscopic view of decision making, and a complete system of morality also needs a macroscopic view. I will fill that in here.

## Utilitarianism and justice

In the section on decision making, I explained that you should make decisions that optimize your goals. Following this principle leads one to a system of morality called *utilitarianism*: you should do that which creates the most goodness for the world.

But actually, I don't think utilitariniasm is a complete system of morality, because it ignores the concept of *justice*. Justice says you cannot do bad things to people if they do not "deserve" it, even if it is for the greater good. It is not acceptable to arbitrarily rearrange the world to optimize goals. The independence of other people must be respected.

To understand this, consider the following thought experiment I heard in my ethics class [TODO thought experiment about hospital]

## The specialness of people

The concept of justice arises from a core tenet of human morality: the inherent specialness of people.

Up until this point I have pretened that the happiness of yourself and others is quantifiable. Unfortunately, it isn't.

Human beings cannot be ascribed a value. They do not have zero value, they do not have infinite value, and they do not have some finite value. The concept of value actually does not even apply. This is what distinguishes people from objects. They are sacred.

## On facts and lies

I hope I've made the case that truth is an inherent goal. Therefore, morality dictates we should tell the truth. However, this principle is not always so simple, so I will expand upon it.

It's possible to be misleading by stating true facts, and this is as bad as lying. Also, telling certain lies is sometimes justifiable, if it leads people to better understands. I will illustrate these two points.

Consider a scenario with two characters: Nancy and Debbie. Nancy asks Debbie: "Do you have five children?". Debbie does in fact have five children, but Debbie responds "I have a child."

In this situation, Debbie has said a true fact: Debbie does in fact have a child. However, Nancy is likely to interpret this response as meaning "I have exactly one child but not five." Debbie has not lied, but Debbie has been misleading by ommitting information. Debbie has led Nancy to the same incorrect conclusion that would have happened if Debbie had simply lied and said "No, I only have one." In other words, being misleading with truth facts in this case is equivalent to lying.

Politicians do this all the time: say a thing which is technically true but likely to mislead people who don't think carefully. This is just as unethical as lying.

Before I go on, you might object by asking me: "Isn't Nancy at fault for not thinking carefully about what Debbie said?"

It is true that when faced with a potentially malicious person, it is in Nancy's best interest to act with prudence. However, it would be a better world if that was unnecessary and Debbie had not been misleading in the first place. Debbie did something Debbie *should* not have done -- therefore, Debbie acted unethically, which is what this document is concerned with.


# Identity and culture

## All that matters is what you do, not who you are

I do not comment on ideologies or groups of people. I only comment on actions.

Do not ask me if I am a liberal or a conservative. I don't think that's a very useful question to ask. Instead, ask me what actions I think the country should take on a particular issue. That's what really matters.

I don't identify as a liberal, or a conservative, or a moderate, or anything. I'm just myself and I have opinions on which actions should be taken in given scenarios. You can agree or disagree with those actions. You can provide evidence and arguments in support or criticism of those actions. That's much more focused than attempting to argue against the entire concept of liberalism or the entire concept of conservativism, and therefore more likely to produce useful ideas.

Do not ask me if I am straight or gay or something else. Instead ask me if I want to have sex with a particular person.

Do not ask me if I am a man or a woman. Would that tell you what kind of job I should have? Would that tell you what kind of clothes I should wear? Would it tell you which other people I am friends with? What kind of books I read or shows I watch? No, it would not. Anyone could have any kind of job, anyone could wear any clothes. Anyone could be friends with anyone. Anyone could read any books or watch any shows. When people apply the label of "man" or "woman" to themselves, it means they want to associate with a given set of steretypes and social roles. Well, I associate with no stereotypes or social roles. I will do whatever I want, regardless if it's a thing that only men are supposed to do or only women are supposed to do.

Identifying as something means applying that label to yourself. Labels can be helpful: they are shorthands for describing what actions you think should be taken in given scenarios. For example, if someone identifies as a liberal, you can make reasonable guesses about what actions they think the country should take in response to certain issues. That kind of shorthand can be helpful, since it is convenient. Labels have other benefits, too. For example, they can provide rallying cries, or banners to march behind.

But even though labels have these sorts of benefits, I think their cons are far stronger, and it is for that reason I refuse to apply labels to myself or others.

Labels encourage echo chambers. Just repeating talking points without thinking through subtleties. Us vs. them mentalities, where other human beings are labeled as demons, as enemies, to be ignored and shunned. They encourage ad hominem attacks, where arguments are ignored on the basis of who they come from rather than for their own benefits. In short, labels erode reasonable argument and conversation.

When you think to yourself: "I'm the kind of person who's not good at math." you become not good at math. It is a self-fulfilling prophesy. I fully believe that most people are able to become good at any one given thing if only they put in the effort. But people labeling themselves limits themselves.

When you label yourself, hearing any argument against your label's position you interpret as a personal attack on your own identity. And once the goodness of your person is brough into question, you will no longer hear logic.

## On culture

Culture is equivalent to identity. All the problems that I complained identity has, culture also has. Therefore I recommend culture being avoided in excess.
